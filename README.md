# Goal

The goal of this repository to have a utility framework for the bot programming game "Ghost in the cell" in [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell).

I wrote this code many years ago, but now I'm reshaping this.

## Correctness

Tests are included, using the examples from the game description from the [website](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell).

Also the following [code](https://github.com/CodinGame/ghost-in-the-cell/blob/master/Referee.java) is used as the referee from Codingame's side.

## Dependencies

 - [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) v1.3.1
   - it has to be installed (make install) on your machine
 - [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) v2.2.0
